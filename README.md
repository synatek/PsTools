## Introduction

PsTools is a comprehensive collection of command-line utilities developed by Microsoft Sysinternals to streamline remote administration, system analysis, and troubleshooting across Windows environments. This toolkit offers a range of lightweight, portable utilities that allow administrators to manage remote machines with precision, without the need for physical access or full software installation on the target hosts.

The suite provides functionality for launching or stopping processes remotely, running applications with specific parameters, controlling services, inspecting active user sessions, and retrieving in-depth system configuration details. PsTools also enables remote command execution, process enumeration, and real-time system observation, helping administrators quickly pinpoint performance bottlenecks and address system-level issues across distributed infrastructures.

Many of the tools operate without requiring installation on the remote system, relying instead on standard Windows administrative privileges and native networking mechanisms such as SMB. Thanks to this approach, PsTools remains efficient, highly automatable, and easy to incorporate into scripting environments, batch tasks, and enterprise management routines.

Due to its robustness, portability, and broad feature set, PsTools continues to be an essential resource for system administrators, DevOps specialists, security professionals, and support teams who depend on fast, scalable, command-driven workflows for managing numerous Windows systems at once.
